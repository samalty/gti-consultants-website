Technological innovation is the lifeblood of modern companies, and not just those businesses which are concerned with software, scientific or industrial markets, but even in fashion, publishing and the food industry. Innovation technology is a crucial part of business for the majority of companies and in fact, modern global business is founded on knowledge development. Innovation technology is something that companies just cannot ignore. 

It’s precisely for this reason that governments provide Research and Development (or R&D) tax incentives to businesses, so as to encourage them to focus on the development of their innovation technology. 

In fact, it’s exactly this innovation technology that makes companies more competitive in the global marketplace, increases the superiority of firms and makes them significantly more attractive to corporate and individual clients alike, who seek them out for their intangible knowledge. The capacity of companies to keep pushing themselves and their people to develop even more sophisticated innovation technology is a benefit to businesses, populations and governments, and it is precisely for this reason that governments are so keen to provide R&D tax incentives to companies. The granting of this incentive provides a space for firms to focus on improving their innovation technology capabilities. 

It’s beneficial for governments as well as the companies receiving the tax incentive; economies are increasingly dependent on intangible economic activities, such as knowledge-based and technological pursuits, and the improvement on innovation technological by firms based within their territories is always going to be a huge boon for them. That’s not to mention, of course, the increased amount of tax that they’ll be paying the governments granting the tax incentives in the future, once their developments finally come to fruition. That’s what makes the grants so worthwhile for governments, as in later years, they are certain to receive a huge return on what they view as an investment. 

Ultimately, the R&D tax incentive provides huge benefits for companies and governments alike; the development of innovation technology breaks downs barriers, improves firm competitiveness, creating jobs, opening up new markets, and increasing technological knowledge for the benefit of humanity.
