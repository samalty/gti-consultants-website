Research and development tax credits, also known as R&D tax credits, are offered by the UK Government to encourage businesses to find innovative solutions to current problems by way of a financial reward. It allows up to 33.35% of a company’s R&D spend to be recovered either as a reduction in Corporation Tax or a cash repayment. 

## How does it work?

If your company spends money on improving new products, services or processes, or on enhancing ones that already exist, you are eligible for Research and Development tax relief. If you’re spending on innovation, then making an R&D tax credit claim will mean you receive a reduction on your Corporation tax or a cash payment. 

The work that qualifies for R&D relief must be part of a specific project to make an advance in technology or science innovation. If you need assistance, a government tax incentive consultant can help by strategically advising you on company project structuring and successfully working with you in sourcing and accessing an applicable incentive.

## Are you eligible? 

If your company is taking a risk by improving, innovating, or developing a product, process or service, then it will likely be eligible for the incentive. The main criteria are: being a limited company in the UK that pays corporation tax, that has undertaken development and research activities, and has put money into these projects. 

If you’re an SME with fewer than 500 staff and a turnover less than 100 million euros, then you claim R&D relief. This allows companies to deduct an additional 130% of their qualifying costs from their annual profit. 

Large companies can claim a Research and Development Expenditure Credit. This can also be claimed by SMEs who have been subcontracted to do R&D work by a larger company. 

## Benefits 

There are great benefits to the R&D tax incentive. It provides a valuable form of financial support for all businesses, as an essential source of non-repayable funding for many enterprises. It also helps encourage businesses to invest in R&D and innovation. 

Research and development tax incentives have the power to transform your business by rewarding innovation and fuelling growth.
