Making an R&D tax claim is a complicated process with many potential pitfalls. To make sure that your business has the best chance of making a successful claim, we've compiled a list of the most common mistakes to avoid when making a research and development tax claim. 

## Not claiming for a loss 

You might make the mistake of assuming that R&D tax credits only apply to businesses that are making a profit, but this is not the case. Companies that are making losses have the chance to reclaim the associated costs, even if the R&D work was not completed successfully. This scheme has been set up to give money back to companies that work in the field of science or innovation technology and is looking to make progress through overall capability or knowledge. So, even if your business has made a loss, you should still receive a reward for your investment. 

## Not record keeping 

As with anything related to HMRC or tax, it is a good idea to maintain comprehensive records that are dated correctly at all times. Meticulously keeping track of your finances and being able to precisely demonstrate how much of your resources have been invested in research and development may be essential to make a successful claim. It's also a good idea to make sure that this information can be accessed easily to ensure that you don't waste any time in future. 

## Not consulting experts 

It is incredibly easy for any business owner to overlook the most important elements of your R&D tax claim. All of these mistakes could be avoided by simply making sure that you consult a team of experts when you're considering making a claim. R&D tax experts will know everything there is to know about how to make a claim successfully, and they have the knowledge and expertise required to guide your business and help you identify any potential successes while providing you with support throughout the entire process.
