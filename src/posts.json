It allows up to 33.35% of a company’s R&D spend to be recovered either as a reduction in Corporation Tax or a cash repayment. \r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\nIf your company spends money on improving new products, services or processes, or on enhancing ones that already exist, you are eligible for Research and Development tax relief. If you’re spending on innovation, then making an R&D tax credit claim will mean you receive a reduction on your Corporation tax or a cash payment. \r\n\r\nThe work that qualifies for R&D relief must be part of a specific project to make an advance in technology or science innovation. If you need assistance, a government tax incentive consultant can help by strategically advising you on company project structuring and successfully working with you in sourcing and accessing an applicable incentive.\r\n\r\n## Are you eligible? \r\n\r\nIf your company is taking a risk by improving, innovating, or developing a product, process or service, then it will likely be eligible for the incentive. The main criteria are: being a limited company in the UK that pays corporation tax, that has undertaken development and research activities, and has put money into these projects. \r\n\r\nIf you’re an SME with fewer than 500 staff and a turnover less than 100 million euros, then you claim R&D relief. This allows companies to deduct an additional 130% of their qualifying costs from their annual profit. \r\n\r\nLarge companies can claim a Research and Development Expenditure Credit. This can also be claimed by SMEs who have been subcontracted to do R&D work by a larger company. \r\n\r\n## Benefits \r\n\r\nThere are great benefits to the R&D tax incentive. It provides a valuable form of financial support for all businesses, as an essential source of non-repayable funding for many enterprises. It also helps encourage businesses to invest in R&D and innovation. \r\n\r\nResearch and development tax incentives have the power to transform your business by rewarding innovation and fuelling growth."},{"id":1637236200,"title":"Innovation technology and benefits of the R&D Tax Incentive\r","category":"HMRC\r","description":"R&D tax incentives encourage businesses to focus on the development of their innovation technology.\r","date":"November 18, 2021","time":"11:50","thumbnail":"/images/insights.jpg\r","content":"\r\nTechnological innovation is the lifeblood of modern companies, and not just those businesses which are concerned with software, scientific or industrial markets, but even in fashion, publishing and the food industry. Innovation technology is a crucial part of business for the majority of companies and in fact, modern global business is founded on knowledge development. Innovation technology is something that companies just cannot ignore. \r\n\r\nIt’s precisely for this reason that governments provide Research and Development (or R&D) tax incentives to businesses, so as to encourage them to focus on the development of their innovation technology. \r\n\r\nIn fact, it’s exactly this innovation technology that makes companies more competitive in the global marketplace, increases the superiority of firms and makes them significantly more attractive to corporate and individual clients alike, who seek them out for their intangible knowledge. The capacity of companies to keep pushing themselves and their people to develop even more sophisticated innovation technology is a benefit to businesses, populations and governments, and it is precisely for this reason that governments are so keen to provide R&D tax incentives to companies. The granting of this incentive provides a space for firms to focus on improving their innovation technology capabilities. \r\n\r\nIt’s beneficial for governments as well as the companies receiving the tax incentive; economies are increasingly dependent on intangible economic activities, such as knowledge-based and technological pursuits, and the improvement on innovation technological by firms based within their territories is always going to be a huge boon for them. That’s not to mention, of course, the increased amount of tax that they’ll be paying the governments granting the tax incentives in the future, once their developments finally come to fruition. That’s what makes the grants so worthwhile for governments, as in later years, they are certain to receive a huge return on what they view as an investment. \r\n\r\nUltimately, the R&D tax incentive provides huge benefits for companies and governments alike; the development of innovation technology breaks downs barriers, improves firm competitiveness, creating jobs, opening up new markets, and increasing technological knowledge for the benefit of humanity."}]
